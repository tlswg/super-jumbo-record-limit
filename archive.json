Since the document will specify a flags extension to be used in combination with the record size limit extension to negotiate a record size limit larger than the currently protocol-defined record size limit, I don't think describing the contents as \"an extension\" or as an \"flags extension\" covers it. Maybe we should also not limit this in the title to 1.3, since it might also work in future versions of the protocol.\r\n\r\n",
